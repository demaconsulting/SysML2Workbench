///     <c>DemaConsulting.SysML2Workbench.PathHelpers</c> helper and instead carries its own copy of the
///     same reviewed pattern. This gives static-analysis tools (such as CodeQL's cs/path-combine query)
///     one reviewed call site instead of several individual <see cref="Path.Combine(string[])"/> calls.
