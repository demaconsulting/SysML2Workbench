///     This class exists to provide a single, auditable point of path-safety enforcement for any
///     operation that combines a base directory with additional path segments. Centralizing the
///     check prevents directory-traversal vulnerabilities from being re-implemented (or forgotten)
///     in each caller, and gives static-analysis tools (such as CodeQL's cs/path-combine query) one
///     reviewed call site instead of dozens of individual <see cref="Path.Combine(string[])"/> calls.
///     All members are stateless and thread-safe.
/// </remarks>

    ///     Safely combines a base path with zero or more path segments, ensuring the result
    ///     remains within the base directory.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    ///     All segments are joined using <see cref="Path.Join(ReadOnlySpan{string})"/>, then the
    ///     combined result is normalized with <see cref="Path.GetFullPath(string)"/> and checked
    ///     against the normalized base using <see cref="Path.GetRelativePath"/>. If the result
    ///     resolves outside the base directory the method throws; otherwise the joined
    ///     (un-normalized) path is returned. The escape check matches only an exact <c>..</c>
    ///     segment or one followed by a directory separator, so names beginning with two dots
    ///     (e.g. <c>..config</c>) are not misidentified as traversal.
    ///     Individual segments may contain <c>..</c> or be rooted provided the combined result
    ///     does not escape the base - for example segments <c>["baa", ".."]</c> on base
    ///     <c>C:\foo</c> resolve back to <c>C:\foo</c> and are accepted.
    ///     When no segments are supplied, returns <paramref name="basePath"/> unchanged.
